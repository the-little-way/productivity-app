This is a little to-do web app I made that covers all parts of a full stack project, i.e.:

1. a front-end with the usual html, css, js

1. back-end with routes and further logic

1. parsing data from external api calls

1. connected database for CRUD operations

While rewriting the front-end in React, I got the idea to redevelop the whole project into a SAAS product (**Project Q**)
