This is a little to-do web app I made mainly to experiment with a web app operates fully on backend logic alone. It is not for commericial use, and originally intended just for portfolio purposes.

This project covers all parts of a full stack project, i.e.:

1. a front-end with the usual html, css, js

1. back-end with routes and further logic

1. parsing data from external api calls

1. connected database for CRUD operations

1. login/register/logout (basic authentication) functionality

While rewriting the front-end in React, I did some market research and then got the idea to redevelop the whole project into a SAAS product (**Project Q**)
